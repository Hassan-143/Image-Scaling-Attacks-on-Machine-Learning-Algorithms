# Image Scaling Attacks on Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the code and resources for the research project on 'Image Scaling Attacks on Machine Learning Algorithms: A Cyber Security Perspective'. It explores the susceptibility of ML algorithms to image scaling attacks, a type of adversarial attack that manipulates the size and resolution of input images to induce incorrect model predictions. The research focuses on traffic sign recognition systems using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. It aims to improve the robustness of these systems against such adversarial manipulations and test adversarial attack strategies on neural network-based classifiers, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built using Keras. For more detailed information, please refer to the research paper included in this repository.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: OpenCV, Pillow, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- OS: Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, or other Linux distributions.

### Installation
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waniashafqat/Image-Scaling-Attacks-on-Machine-Learning-Algorithms.git
   cd Image-Scaling-Attacks-on-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Dataset and Model
* Download the GTSRB dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
* Preprocess train the model using the `GTSRB Model.ipynb`

## Usage
* For finding vulnerabilities in ML model run `Interpolations.ipynb`
* Implement image scaling attacks on GTSRB model using `Image Scaling Attacks.ipynb`
* For defense mechanisms use `Defenses.ipynb`

## Attack Analysis
- Dataset and Model: Utilizes the GTSRB dataset and Keras-based CNN models.
- Attack Design: Focuses on creating adversarial images using image scaling techniques.
- Perturbations and Norms: Implements L0, L2, and Lâˆž norms to generate minimal but effective perturbations.
- Interpolation Techniques: Employs various interpolation methods to understand their impact on attack effectiveness.

## Defenses
Several defense mechanisms are proposed to counteract image scaling attacks:
- Pixel-wise Difference
- Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
- Color Histogram-Based Detection
- Robust Scaling Algorithms
